If you get this error : 
$ git clone https?://github.com/hipoonia/TestGit.git
Cloning into 'TestGit'...
fatal: protocol '' is not supported

1. Try restarting the git bash.
or
2. Remove the space between git, clone and https and re enter a space.
Because earlier it might be some other invisible character other than actual space.
Worked for so..
